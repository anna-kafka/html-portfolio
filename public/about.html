<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Anna. On June 13, I started my adventure with learning how to create
  websites. This was made possible by the IBM Program, which I managed to get
  to. I was delighted to be able to participate in IBM's Program Front-end Web
  Development. Thanks to this Program I was able to build this website in html.
  And I'm very happy that she looks so good.
</p>

<p>
  My goal is to learn how to code websites as best I can in order to become a
  Front-End Developer in the future. Therefore, in this course I will learn
  other languages such as CSS and JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
  I will strive to improve my skills so that the websites I create in the future
  will have an even better look and become interactive.
